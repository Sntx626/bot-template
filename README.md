# bot-template

This template is made so I can use it to clone it easily and write different modules for discord bots.

## The folder `cog`

### The file `bot-template.py`

This file contains an empty cog. It will be copied into the `cogs` folder of the main bot upon installation. It is recommended to rename the classname.

## The folder `config`

### The file `config.json.example`

This json file will be used to create a `config.json` file. The contents of `config.json` will be appended to the `config.json`'s dictionary of the main bot.

### The file `requirements.txt`

These requirements will be appended to the `requirements.txt` file of the main bot.
